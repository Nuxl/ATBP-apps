ATBP Apps
==========

A basic edit of quetzle's Smash Apps to allow ATBP tier listing.

[Use them!](http://quetzle.github.io/smash-apps)

Currently, the apps are:

* [Stage Striking](http://quetzle.github.io/smash-apps/stage) - choose what stage to play on by banning certain stages!
* [Tier List Maker](http://quetzle.github.io/smash-apps/tier) - create a tier list to show how you think the characters stack up!
* [Color Ranks](http://quetzle.github.io/smash-apps/colors) - choose what your favorite colors are for each character!
* [Color Tier List Maker](http://quetzle.github.io/smash-apps/colortiers) - create a tier list of every color in the game!
